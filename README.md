This is a simple videogame called PONK!

To get it working on Windows, download and extract the .zip file and run the PONK.exe inside the resulting folder!

For Linux, download and extract the .tar.gz, open a terminal in the resulting directory and build and execute the game with the command: ./buildAndRun.sh
(If this doesn't work, you probably need to give yourself execute permission, try chmod +x buildAndRun.sh)
