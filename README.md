This is a simple videogame for Linux called PONK!

To get it working, extract the tarball, open a terminal in the resulting directory and build and execute the game with the command: ./buildAndRun.sh

(If this doesn't work, you probably need to give yourself execute permission, try chmod +x buildAndRun.sh)
